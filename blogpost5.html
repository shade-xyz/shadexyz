            <h3>The Introduction</h3>
            <p>"Red Mantle" redirects here. For the 1967 film also known as The Red Mantle, see Hagbard and Signe.</p>
            <h3>Some Information:</h3>
            <p>Aka Manto (赤マント, Red Cloak),[1] also known as Red Cape,[2] Red Vest,[1] Akai-Kami-Aoi-Kami (赤い紙青い紙, Red Paper, Blue Paper),[3] or occasionally Aoi Manto (青マント, Blue Cloak),[3] is a Japanese urban legend about a masked spirit who wears a red cloak, and who appears to people using toilets in public or school bathrooms.[3] Accounts of the legend vary, but one consistent element of the story is that the spirit will ask the occupant of a toilet a question. In some versions, he will ask if they want red paper or blue paper, though other versions identify the choices as a red cloak or a blue cloak, or as a red cape or a blue cape. Choosing either option will result in the individual being killed, so the individual must ignore the spirit, run away, or reject both options in order to survive.</p>
            <h3>The legend and its variations</h3>
            <p>Aka Manto is described as a male spirit, ghost, or yōkai who haunts public or school bathrooms.[4] Aka Manto is often said to haunt female bathrooms specifically, and in some versions of the legend, he is said to haunt the last stall in such bathrooms.[4] The spirit is said to wear a flowing red cloak and a mask which hides his face, and is sometimes described as being handsome and charming beneath his mask.[3][4]

                According to legend, if a person is sitting on a toilet in a public or school bathroom, Aka Manto may appear, and will ask them if they want red paper or blue paper.[3][5] Depending on the version of the story, the spirit may ask them to choose between a red cloak and a blue cloak,[6] or between a red cape and a blue cape. If they choose the "red" option, they will be lacerated in such a manner that their dead body will be drenched in their own blood.[7] The specific manner in which the person is lacerated differs depending on the account of the legend, including the person being stabbed or flayed.[1] Their body could also be ripped off their spine and tied around their neck as if it was a red cape. If the individual chooses the "blue" option, the consequences range from that person being strangled to all of the person's blood being drained from their body.[8]
                
                If an individual attempts to outsmart Aka Manto by asking for a different color of paper, cloak, or cape, it is often said that they will be dragged to an underworld or hell as a result.[9][10] In some versions, choosing a "yellow" paper, cloak or cape will result in the occupant's head being forced into the toilet.[1][11] Ignoring the spirit, or replying that one does not want or prefer either kind of paper, is said to make the spirit go away.[11] In some accounts, rejecting both options and running away from Aka Manto will also result in the individual's survival, although sometimes Aka Manto will simply block the exit.[1]</p>
